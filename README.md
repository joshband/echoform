# Stereo Memory Delay Plugin

This repository contains the skeleton of a JUCE-based stereo memory delay audio plug‑in.  For a detailed implementation plan, refer to `../plugin_implementation_plan.md` in the parent directory.

## Structure

- `src/` — C++ source files for the plug‑in (currently stubs).
- `CMakeLists.txt` — build configuration using JUCE’s CMake API.
- `.vscode/` — VS Code configuration files.

To build the project, install JUCE, open this folder in VS Code, and follow the instructions in the implementation plan.
